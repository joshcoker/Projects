This is called a volume because the results are in cubic inches or meters. The value is then divided by the area of the wing, and the average wing chord. Dividing by the wing area makes it relative to the wing area, a ratio to the wing area, and dividing by the wing chord makes the NP value relative to the chord, a percentage/fraction of the chord value.\n",
